Apache Lucene NearRealtimeSearch Guide

version 1.0 November 9, 2011
--------------------------------

I will show through this documentation how to successfully configure Py-Lucene 3.4.0-x
Since Lucene is written in Java for the JVM, you will need JCC to use python to communicate 
with the JVM. Standard builds of Py-Lucene should include JCC in the sources.

Basic requirements:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Ant
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* The setuptools package is required to build and run PyLucene on Python 2.3.5. With later versions of Python, setuptools is only required for 
  shared mode. See JCC's installation instructions for more information. 

The rest of setup instructions for configuring Py-Lucene can be found in docs/install

Note that NearRealtimeSearch has been available beginning with Lucene 2.9
