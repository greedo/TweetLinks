How to install PyLucene
------------------------

These are steps you will need to run in order

1. pushd jcc

2. Now you will need to configure setup.py to match you machines configuration. This should be fine.

3. python setup.py build

4. sudo python setup.py install

5. popd

6. Now you will need to configure the Makefile to match your environment. I will show you mine as a reference.
   There are several commented sections based on different environment. Since un-comment the one matching you
   configuration.

   For Example: I am running Ubuntu 11.10, Python 2.7, OpenJDK 1.6, setuptools 0.6c9

   So mine looks like:

   # Linux     (Ubuntu 8.10 64-bit, Python 2.5.2, OpenJDK 1.6, setuptools 0.6c9)
   PREFIX_PYTHON=/usr
   ANT=ant
   PYTHON=$(PREFIX_PYTHON)/bin/python
   JCC=$(PYTHON) -m jcc --shared
   NUM_FILES=3

   It is very important that jcc is compiled with the --shared flag to allow JCC and Python to share memory space 
   for variables.

   Just as a sanity check make sure the top information is correct for version and locations:

   VERSION=3.4.0
   LUCENE_SVN_VER=HEAD
   LUCENE_VER=3.4.0
   LUCENE_SVN=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/tags/lucene_solr_3_4_0
   PYLUCENE:=$(shell pwd)
   LUCENE_SRC=lucene-java-$(LUCENE_VER)
   LUCENE=$(LUCENE_SRC)/lucene

7. make

8. sudo make install

9. make test (This is not required)

The make process may take a while, so do not exit until it has completed it's work. This is very normal.
You should now have a working copy of Py-Lucene install, basic tutorials all also included with the install.
See the rest of my code in TweetLinks for how I actually use Py-Lucene in my work.
